      <h1>This why <strong>Flex</strong> makes amazing pet companion</h1>
      <h2> Written from <em>experience</em> from living with the pitbull named Flexington</h2>

      <p>Flex is an 80lb pitbull with puppy dog eyes and a killer personality</p>
      <p>He is very fond of playing catch and that's how we made friends</p>

      <p>Here are some things he <strong>LOVES</strong> to do</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Going on long walks by the river</li>
        <li>Playing fetch with a glow-in-the-dark ball</li>
        <li>Sleeping in a human bed until noon, like a good lazy BOI!</li>
        <li>Graciously eating his food and drinking his water (what a good BOI!)</li>
      </ul>
